This campaign is set right before the Jedi-Sith war in the old republic era before the MMO but after KoToR 1 and 2. The year is 3,683 BBY or 21,370 RE. I'm heavily inspired by the history written in the MMO, but I'm taking some creative freedoms. 

I have a bunch of stuff figured out for lore, but I'm wondering how to organize the information, and was hoping you had some suggestions: I have things as specific as character sheets for statted out NPCs, but I have ideologies for different factions and the organaztion structures within as well as info about the planets in the galaxy, the hyperspace routes.

The overall mood/theme is to create a fantastical star wars world with fair while sometimes harsh consequences. The players encounter factions that have leaders who have policitics between them and their choices and actions reverberate with how they are recieved on different planets. I try to make most characters multi-dimensional, not wholly good or bad operating off their own philosophies. Philosophically, I intend to critique neoliberal expansion and corruption with the republic. I can also critique fascism with the Sith, capitalism through the depiction of Czerka, something else with the Mandalorians and Jedis. Basically all factions will have a clear world view that they want others to adopt, and the players can interact. Initially, I'm focusing on the PCs staying on Coruscant for a while, but eventually they can buy their own ship and there are already plot threads leading them to various planets throughout the galaxy. Also it's star wars, so there are big setpieces and exciting conspriacies.

The SIS is inspired by the CIA/FBI IRL so they serve the republic, but lack morals and are prone to corruption/bias. Not to say there aren't good or well-meaning people working for them.

Belos Omati is the supreme Chancellor and he’s kind of supposed to mirror Obama, where he’s well liked and popular by other people, but he’s also kind of militaristic and expansionist and sending out a lot of like drones and stuff to expand the republic into hutt space. 

The jedi council is particularly militaristic at this time and is closely aligned with the republic and SIS. There is no one leader, but the members of the council are reasonably aligned on this.

Emporer Vitiate is the leader of the sith empire and is waiting to attack hiding beyond the outer rim. This is more or less like the MMO, but I may tweak this as the sith presence grows in the story.

A year ago I ran a few sessions with a different group that I want to incorporate into the story. The main conflict going on there was a Jedi Padawan named Alya Vek was on a planet, where the Republic SIS had given attack drones and weapons to miners on this planet, and the miners were using that to fight back against the hutts who were subjecting them to poor working conditions, but the miners didn’t really know how to use the technology and ended up causing a lot of casualties for themselves because they are powerful weapons that are dangerous and difficult to control without training and so Alya had fled the Jedi temple after returning to coruscant to the under city.

Alya Vek was on Kwenn with her master, Vockor Maff, when there were efforts to convince the miners to rebel against the Hutts. The SIS was also providing the miners with drones to take out their bosses, but they didn't know how to use them which caused civilian casualties. She stole a SIS holorecord when she left, and wanting to stop the casualties as quickly as possible, Alya reaches out to Durzoka the Hutt. In response, the Hutts sent Gamorrean Guards to assist her disseminating the info. However, the SIS noticed the missing holorecord and the guards arrival on Coruscant. 

BA-136 is an green camo assassin droid and a SIS combat droid assigned to track down Hutt agents who are presumed to have holorecord. Had memory wiped in last 2 months. Has worked for Zullari since.

In the first of the proto-sessions, the PCs went on the mission with BA-136 to find the holorecord. They encountered Alya and started fighting. They killed the gamorrean guards that were sent, but allied with Alya. BA-136 then turned on the whole party and tried to kill Alya. The party defeated BA-136, although T0-ME died. In the aftermath, the unassuming astromech droid, R1-J8, offered to pay the rest of the mercenaries to seek out a journalist with Alya to publish the contents of the holorecord the padawan had smuggled from the surface of Kwenn. Time will tell how the SIS and Hutt Cartel will respond.

While Cray and R1-J8 went to repair T-0ME, Alya was able to get in touch with Tia Rell, a strikingly handsome Twi'lek reporter for the Corscant Echo. Additionally, Sibble the Kushiban monk went off to the upper levels to pursue leads on getting an interview with a journalist from the HoloNet News, the largest media organization in the Galaxy. With T0-ME back in working order and a covert interview planned with Rell, the mercenaries are set to meet in a night market hoping to publish the story of the SIS's bloody affairs on Kwenn. Feeling the absence of Sibble and their near brush with mortality from the last mission, R1-J8 was able to hire additional help should any foul play arise while they continue to assist Alya. As the time of the interview approaches, the bustling brouhaha of the night market drowns out both their words and their worries: shrouding them in anonymity and muffling any signs of danger creeping in from the shadows.

Alya gave Tia Rell a short but empassioned interview. Unbeknownst to the players Tia was working with Czerka and accepted a bribe to give his source away to Q'russ, a bounty hunter hired by an angered Durzoka (after hearing about the guards deaths) after Tia got the interview from Alya. 

After Tia finished, he quickly took a speeder away, and Q'russ the bounty hunter snuck up to capture the party with a few hirelings. The party killed the hirelings and Q'russ, but the commotion garnered the attention of Galen, who began to snipe at them while junior agents attempted to kill the party and destroy the holorecord.

Following through on their promise to the anxious but wholesome padawan, Alya Vek, our mercenaries defended the jedi from both Czerka bounty hunters and narrowly escaped the cross hairs of a surprisingly chill but menacing Galen Zullari. Vek was able to share a copy of her holorecord with Coruscant Echo reporter, Tia Rell, although he seemed to have a hurried departure.

After an exhilarating exodus from the night market, Alya, R1-J8, and T0-ME, meet up with Cray and new face he was able to recruit to the cause--Tarisha Rex--at Naviya's Cantina where they hope to find a fewer prying eyes. A'koba and Xerses went their separate ways after receiving payment from R1, and Sibble remains in contact with the party, sending updates about HNN. The bar is surprisingly quiet for a Zhellday night, but a competent Bith band grooves in the corner providing a calm ambiance. As you take a seat, you see a devaronian bar-tender who you think might be Naviya give you a nod as she cleans a cup. At the end of the bar there sits a heavily armored man polishing his blaster rifle. Just outside the entrance, you hear the faint cries of an Ithorian urchin. A couple minutes after you sit down, a familar voice comes over the holoscreen...


The old party talked to the Mandalorian. They did a mission for him, but when they returned Vockor Maff came to warn Alya that she must return to the surface. 

Q'russ was bounty hunter for Durzoka. He died in the night market, but he could be revived?

In their session 0, this party started a mission en media res where they had stowed aboard the ship of Ji-toh Coreft, a Cerean Jedi Knight with an affinity for droids. Because of this, the council had sent him out to M4-78 to see if the planet would be suitable for republic expansion efforts, but he had gone missing, and the SIS hired the PCs to investigate. The PCs are vaguely familiar with each other ostensibly traveling together for a week, but don't yet have fleshed out back stories. 

In the beginning of session 0 the PCs emerge from the cargo hold and confront Coreft, who has a Baradian Compression Bomb and intends to fly into the Jedi Temple to destroy it. After a half hearted attempt to talk with Ji-toh, Tarku tries to pull out a gadget that will move him away from the cockpit, initating combat. The players nearly die with all players except Rashka going down at times, but they are able to kill Ji-toh and stop the ship from crashing into the Temple. However, right before they killed ji-toh, it seemed like all hope was lost and Rashka hot-wired a damaged escape pod and shot off.
